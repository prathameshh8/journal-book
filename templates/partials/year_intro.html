        <p>I’m Prathamesh. Gave my 10th boards this year, scored 86.4% with no coaching. Just smart work.</p>
        <p>After that, chilled with Minecraft, then got deep into copywriting and growth. Wrote two books. Obsessed with to-do lists.</p>
        <p>Started a dev agency (tmux.io). No clients, but learned a lot. Smashed my phone in a fight, never replaced it. More peace since.</p>
        <p>Now building Nexttap, a productivity app based on how I work. 3+ months in. No earnings yet.</p>
        <p>Goal: $500/month and crack a free CS college. Still figuring it out. But I’m all in.</p>

        <p>I'm Prathamesh, and I just want to build businesses that let me take care of my parents and live free.</p>
        <p>Started out wanting a Minecraft account. Ended up making my first $160 online at 16 through YouTube automation.</p>
        <p>Tried trading, dropshipping, affiliate, copywriting. failed at most. Shiny object syndrome every week. But I kept moving.</p>
        <p>Now I'm focused. Want to live on farmland, earn from my laptop, lift some weights, and talk to billionaires online once in a while.</p>
        <p>This is just the start.</p>
