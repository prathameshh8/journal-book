Brother, today was one of the best days of my life man. Literally the best day of my whole fucking life.

I went to the sunset point of my town, it’s like a small valley-type place where there’s this lush, never-ending green forest.

I saw one man who was releasing a caught snake from a jar from the top of the valley.

I was with my friend Sahil, who's been my bro since forever.

There were 2 other people there watching the snake release too.

We had a really good conversation with one of them. The other one was busy talking to his buddy.

I had a good handshake with that guy, we talked, and my friend had a good handshake too.  
 Then we went to MIDC, which is kinda like sunset point, lush and green, but it’s an industrial area.

We had some snacks there, and the tank was empty. Boom.

We were in the middle of nowhere, in an industrial area, it was getting dark.  
 Somehow we managed to push the scooter and got to the highway. Sometimes it started, sometimes it didn’t.

But then there was this school teacher we used to have. We didn’t want to pass his house while pushing the scooter like some helpless people. Man, just no.  
 It was really funny for us. We were like, no matter what, we are not crossing his house like this.

So we decided to take a chance. We started push-pulling the scooter, back and forth, hoping that one small drop of petrol hits the engine and somehow we cross that 100-meter road.  
 And boom, scooter started.

We were really excited to cross the road and that house.

We fully accelerated the scooter. He was riding it btw. He gave full throttle and boom...\!\!

We stopped right in front of the house we didn’t want to cross like that.

And bro we were laughing so much. Like so much. I can’t even explain it in text. Shit was mad funny.

It started.  
 It accelerated well.  
 But but but... it just decided to stop *right* in front of the house.

Lol.

Then we hit the highway. My dad saw me. He was sitting outside an Indian-style dhaba talking with the owner.  
 He showed me his hand like, "Hey son, come here."

I went to him and he’s like, "Here’s 50 rupees, take it."  
 I explained what happened and he said, "Go get some petrol in a bottle."  
 But the problem was the petrol pump was far.

Then we met a friend. He was like a lifesaver.  
 I took the bottle from the dhaba and the 50 rupees and said to my friend, "Bro, let me go. It’ll be awkward if I stay here with my dad."  
 I’m not really that open with my dad like that.

So I made my friend get off the scooter and explained why I didn’t like the idea of both of them going and me staying.  
 He didn’t really understand what I was feeling, but anyway, I talked with him. Had a good talk.

I got the petrol from the pump.

When I came back, fuck... we had relatives over. Two people, around our age, like 20s, and they were ready to help.

Out of nowhere, we had options now.

Suddenly one of the relatives says, "Isn’t there petrol in your scooter boot?"

Sahil checks the boot and goes, "Oh fuck..."

We already had petrol there.

We fucking pushed that scooter like pyramid slaves.

Now I had 50 rupees petrol in hand and more already in his boot.

Fuck. And lol.

We literally did this pushing shit for like 3 to 4 KM straight.

Then we finally reached home. He dropped me at my place. And we just sat back and enjoyed what the heck happened to us today. Really fun day tbh.

And brother, we also talked about our other brother. He’s not with us anymore, like he’s out of town for studies.  
 But now he lives with completely different people. Like degenerates. And we saw such a big change in his behaviour, his thinking, his whole mindset.  
 It’s not the same person we were friends with before.

He changed.

Also realised today how badly the people around you can affect your mindset if they’re not the right kind of people.

Anyways, good day overall.

Also, I gave my bike (cycle) to the repair shop today. It was like 4 to 5 km of cycling in the morning.

From this 10 km of physical travel, my body is fully exhausted today, bro. Like totally done.

Anyways.

I’m grateful for a good day.  
 I’m grateful my bike will be repaired.  
 I’m grateful for bhakarwadi.  
 And I’m grateful for this one good day… after so many lonely days.

Used chatgpt for fixing the grammar but tone and the story is OG.
