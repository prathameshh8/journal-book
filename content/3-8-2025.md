okay so today was actually one of the best days i've had in weeks. not because everything was perfect but because i finally made a move that felt right. like really fucking right.

here’s what happened

i made a mistake. or wait maybe not a mistake. i learned from it and if you really learn something from a mistake it ain’t a mistake anymore right. there’s this line from a rapper i follow something like “the one who learns from defeat isn’t actually defeated.” that line hit me hard. because it perfectly sums up what i went through.

so a few weeks back i decided to move my whole project yeah nexttap, the actual core app from vite.js to next.js. and at the time i thought i was being smart. i was like “yeah man, this’ll be good for long-term scalability blah blah.” but yesterday i realized what a dumb move that was.

it all started because i found this landing page template online. it was made for next.js. instead of converting that small template to vite which would’ve been a small fix, i went full psycho mode and decided to move the whole fucking project to next.js. like changing the entire car just because one tire had a puncture. what the fuck was i thinking

three weeks went down the drain. three. fucking. weeks.

and i don’t even know next.js that well. i was literally just feeding shit to the ai like “pls fix this,” “pls migrate that.” no real thinking, no real building just endless cycles of npm run build → error → fix → build again → error again. it was a loop of insanity. no productivity. just headaches.

and honestly i’m not a dev. i’m a fucking entrepreneur. i build stuff to solve problems not to over-engineer a tech stack that no one even asked for. like bro i don’t even have real users yet. what the hell am i doing worrying about “long-term scalability” that’s like worrying about marriage when i haven’t even been on a date.

so yesterday i did the right thing. the smartest move in weeks.

i ditched the migration

thanks to github and some luck i got my original vite.js code back. i recovered everything. and i made the final call i’m sticking to vite.js. no more next.js bs. it works it’s fast it’s easy and it’s enough. i’m not here to impress other devs. i’m here to build and ship shit that helps people. that’s it.

and for the landing page yeah i’ll convert that next.js template into vite manually. way easier than converting my whole app. hundreds of times easier. makes actual sense.

this was a huge mindset shift

people love to complicate things especially marketers and devs. they want their job to look rocket-science-level hard but in reality most of it is pretty simple if you just stay focused on the outcome. solve the problem get paid. that’s the game.

so yeah yesterday marked a new direction

i’m not wasting time anymore chasing the “perfect tech stack” i’m sticking with what works. i’m gonna focus on shipping on launching on getting real feedback on solving real shit. that’s how i’ll win.

- I am great full for solving this migration prob.
- I am great full for learning from my mistakes.
