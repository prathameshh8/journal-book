so today i tried to woke up at 6
but i was in that half-sleep drunk kind of state
so i just put a timer for 30 mins
then again 30 mins
then again
and then slept without even putting timer
and finally waked up at 10

after that did some house chores
important ones
did that
then little bit of workout
nothing special

today was really stressful bro
one of the worst day of this whole month
had a fight with someone
not gonna mention who
but yeah it was really irritating

so i just went to that lush green spot of my town
just to find some peace
got my mtb repaired so
took the cycle there
called my friend too
we did a nice walk
talked
i did some cycling too
so like a good one hour of movement

also did some chest workout later
little bit of push-ups
nothing big
just felt like doing it

on the way back i saw one guy with his dog
i just asked what’s the name of the dog
he said ruby
nothing else
just felt like socialising a bit

then came back home
again had some clashes
again stress
mind is completely gone
momentum lost
mindset empty
no productivity
did literally nothing today

and yeah
when you have fights in your environment
your mind just doesn’t want to work
you don’t feel like doing anything

but i’ll wake up early tomorrow
and start again from zero
that’s it

- I am grateful for asking dog's name
- I am grateful for the nice sunset view
- I am grateful for nice walk
